The snmp package defines classes used to communicate with SNMP
devices. Classes corresponding to each of the basic SNMP data types are
defined, each extending the SNMPObject abstarct class. In addition, some
utility classes provide additional functionality.
<p>Each of the SNMPObject subclasses defines methods to create an object,
either from a "reasonable" representation (e.g., Java.lang.Integer for
an SNMPInteger object, or a suitable String such as "1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.0"
for an SNMPObjectIdentifier), or from a byte array presumed to contain
a valid ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER) encoding of a value of the appropriate
type. The objects also define methods that permit their values to be set,
and generate their BER encodings.
<p>SNMPSequence subclasses, in particular, contain Vectors of other SNMPObject
subclasses. They can be created "manually", with objects added as desired,
or can be created from a BER encoding of the sequence contents, recursively
creating the contained objects. BER generation also recursively generates
the BER for each contained component; thus calling&nbsp; mySequence.getBerEncoding()
automatically generates the encoding for the entire sequence, including
the contained components. SNMPBERCodec contains a number of static utility
methods for converting to and from BER encodings, as well as constants
used by the various classes.
<p>Finally, SNMPv1CommunicationsInterface defines methods for sending SNMP
Get and Set requests to devices; this class handles all of the communication
tasks needed for developing simple SNMP applications.
